## Project Description
This application is a web app where people can upload their own SignalRGB effects. For context, SignalRGB is an application that controls the RGB of many different brands in one software. In SignalRGB you can make your own effects with javascript. The community makes a bunch of effects, but the majority of them never show up in SignalRGB, because SignalRGB has a strict verification process before something gets shown in SignalRGB. That’s why I want to make a Web App where people can upload their own effects, without first having to go through the verification process, this will make it way more accessible to a bunch of creators.

So now for the feature description, effect creators should be able to register their own account and upload their own effects without having strict effect restrictions. On the main page users should be able to see these effects and be able to download them for use in SignalRGB. Logged in users should also be able to favorite the effects they like, so they can easily see if an effect has a new update. Based on downloads and favorites the most popular integrations will show up first on the main page. Users should also be able to preview the effects before they download them.
